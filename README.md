# Design for your Home — Professional Interior Design Portfolio

A high-fidelity, conversion-focused landing page for an interior design studio. This version upgrades the initial layout with enhanced UI/UX elements, interactive galleries, and social proof.

This project is intentionally lightweight: built with semantic HTML, modern CSS, and vanilla JavaScript to ensure maximum performance and accessibility — no frameworks required.

## Features

- **Dynamic Service Grid**: A modern 2x2 card layout with custom iconography for better scannability.
- **Enhanced Gallery Interaction**: Integrated Lightbox functionality allowing users to view project images in high resolution.
- **Social Proof Integration**: Dedicated testimonial section to build visitor trust and authority.
- **Dynamic UX**: Smooth scroll-reveal animations and a sticky navigation bar with a primary CTA.
- **Mobile-First Design**: Fully responsive architecture optimized for all screen sizes.
- **Simulated Lead Generation**: Functional contact form with real-time submission feedback.

## Tech Stack

- **HTML5**: Semantic structure for SEO and accessibility.
- **CSS3**: Custom properties (CSS variables), Flexbox, and Grid.
- **Vanilla JavaScript**: Intersection Observer API for animations and custom Lightbox logic.

## Case Study (Short)

### Problem

The studio needed to move beyond a simple "digital brochure" to a commercial portfolio that demonstrates quality, professionalism, and ease of contact without the overhead of heavy frameworks.

### Solution

I implemented a series of UI/UX enhancements focused on engagement:

- Visual Hierarchy: Organized services into interactive cards to reduce cognitive load.
- Engagement: Added a Lightbox to the gallery, acknowledging that interior design clients prioritize visual detail.
- Motion Design: Utilized scroll-triggered animations to create a premium, "alive" feel.
- Trust: Inserted client testimonials to provide immediate social proof.

### Outcome

A fast-loading, professional-grade portfolio that successfully balances aesthetics with functionality. The site is fully responsive, easy to maintain, and ready for deployment.

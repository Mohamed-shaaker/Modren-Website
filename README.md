# Design for your Home — Landing Page (v1)

A clean, conversion-focused landing page for an interior design studio.

This project is intentionally simple: semantic HTML, modern CSS, and minimal vanilla JavaScript to support usability and conversion — no frameworks.

## Features

- Single-page layout (hero, services, about, gallery, contact)
- Responsive design (mobile-first)
- Sticky header with primary CTA
- CTA reinforcement on scroll (subtle, JS-assisted)
- Contact form with simulated submit feedback
- Design tokens (CSS variables) for spacing, color, and radius

## Tech Stack

- HTML5 (semantic)
- CSS3 (custom properties, grid, responsive utilities)
- Vanilla JavaScript (no dependencies)

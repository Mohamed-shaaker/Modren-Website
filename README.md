# Design for your Home — Landing Page (v1)

A clean, conversion-focused landing page for an interior design studio.

This project is intentionally simple: semantic HTML, modern CSS, and minimal vanilla JavaScript to support usability and conversion — no frameworks.

## Features

- Single-page layout (hero, services, about, gallery, contact)
- Responsive design (mobile-first)
- Sticky header with primary CTA
- CTA reinforcement on scroll (subtle, JS-assisted)
- Contact form with simulated submit feedback
- Design tokens (CSS variables) for spacing, color, and radius

## Tech Stack

- HTML5 (semantic)
- CSS3 (custom properties, grid, responsive utilities)
- Vanilla JavaScript (no dependencies)

## Project Structure

```
index.html
assets/
  css/
    style.css
  js/
    main.js
  images/
```

## Local Development

Open `index.html` directly in your browser  
or use a local server (recommended):

```bash
npx serve
```

## Case Study (Short)

### Problem

The client needed a clean, modern landing page for an interior design studio that clearly communicates trust, services, and encourages visitors to get in touch — without heavy frameworks or complex setup.

### Solution

I designed and built a single-page, conversion-focused landing page using semantic HTML, modern CSS, and minimal vanilla JavaScript.  
Key decisions included:

- Strong hero section with clear value proposition
- Sticky header with primary CTA for constant visibility
- Clear service hierarchy and readable content width
- Lightweight JavaScript for navigation, scroll feedback, and form UX

### Outcome

The result is a fast-loading, responsive landing page that works across devices, is easy to maintain, and is ready for real client use or further expansion.
